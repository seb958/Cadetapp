The previous AI engineer's trajectory involved a detailed implementation of a uniform inspection feature for the existing Expo application, followed by a significant debugging phase, and finally the integration of offline capabilities. Initially, the engineer focused on backend development, creating models and API endpoints for uniform inspections and scheduling. This was followed by building the frontend UI, including a dedicated screen and linking it from the main menu. A crucial user request for numerical scoring of uniform criteria led to further modifications in both backend and frontend to support a 0-4 point scale.

The subsequent debugging cycles were extensive, primarily revolving around two persistent issues: incorrect uniform criteria being displayed/saved and the saving one cadet inspects all bug. The criteria problem stemmed from a combination of initial frontend default overwriting, incomplete backend settings, and eventually, the user's manual Tenue test conflicting with predefined settings. This required aggressive cache clearing, a backend script to re-seed correct settings, and a frontend Réinitialiser button. The inspects all bug, which caused 20-25 phantom inspections to appear, was ultimately traced to the backend querying the wrong MongoDB database/collection ( vs. ), a critical environment misconfiguration.

Finally, the engineer integrated offline support for uniform inspections, mirroring the presence feature. This involved extending  and  to record inspections locally and updating the backend's  to process them. A last-minute bug in offline saving was identified as a  due to  of  while offline, which the engineer is currently addressing by changing to a static import.

<product_requirements>
The application is a cadet squadron management system with core features like JWT authentication, attendance recording, and an administration panel for CRUD operations on activities, users, sections, and squadron settings.

Key enhancements prior to this trajectory included:
- **Role Synchronization:** Dynamic integration of admin-defined roles.
- **Subgroup Management:** Hierarchical subgroups within sections with responsibles.
- **Organigramme:** Tree-like visualization of squadron hierarchy.
- **Offline Mode with Synchronization:** For presences and uniform inspections, merging data upon reconnection and 6-hour offline usage.
- **Improved Attendance Taking:** Collapsible, section-based lists, real-time search, swipe-right for present, auto-mark absent, 24-hour modification window for users, admin-only thereafter.

The current trajectory focused on developing **Uniform Inspection functionality**:
- **Detailed Inspection:** Based on criteria and a numerical scoring scale (0-4 points) defined in admin settings.
- **Permissions:** Restricted to section leaders and superiors.
- **UI/UX:** Detailed form with suggestions for list condensation or swipeable elements as cadets are inspected.
- **Presence Integration:** Saving an inspection automatically marks an absent cadet as present, with a notification.
- **Uniform Scheduling:** Ability to select the uniform of the day in advance or immediately, configurable by Adjudant d'escadron, Adjudant Chef d'escadron, or Officer. Predefined uniform types only, no score/element modification at selection.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack:** Expo (React Native), FastAPI (Python), MongoDB.
- **Data Persistence:**  for frontend offline caching, MongoDB for backend.
- **Network Management:**  for offline detection.
- **Frontend UI/UX:**  for navigation, , , custom components (, ).
- **Backend Data Validation:** Pydantic models.
- **Synchronization:** Offline queue for presences and uniform inspections, batch sync endpoint.

<code_architecture>
The application features a full-stack architecture with an Expo (React Native) frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   :
    -   **Summary:** Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Added Pydantic models , , ,  (updated for uniform settings).
        -   Implemented  (POST to create, GET to retrieve filtered).
        -   Implemented  (POST to create/update, GET to retrieve today's schedule).
        -   Updated  to correctly process  items from the offline queue, saving them to the  collection and automatically marking cadets as  if they were  or had no presence status.
        -   Updated  GET endpoint to return a default  object if no settings are found, preventing frontend from overwriting.
        -   Fixed issue where initial backend response for  was an empty  object, causing frontend defaults to be overwritten.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Application entry point.
    -   **Changes:** Added navigation link to the new  screen.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Administrative panel.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Modified  to actually call the backend API instead of simulating.
        -   Updated  to fetch from the backend and use default values only if backend settings are truly empty/non-existent, preventing overwrites.
        -   Added logic to automatically save default settings to backend if not present.
        -   Removed  dependency on  to prevent infinite loops.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** New screen for uniform inspections.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Initial creation, including UI for listing cadets, selecting a uniform, displaying criteria, and an inspection modal.
        -   Implemented numerical scoring (0-4) for criteria within the modal, replacing simple toggles.
        -   Integrated  hook and  component.
        -   Added a Réinitialiser button to clear local state () and  for inspections, and reload data.
        -   Modified  to reload  after scheduling a new uniform.
        -   Modified  to use  when offline.
        -   Added anti-cache headers to API calls.
        -   **Current:** Replaced dynamic  with static  to enable offline saving.
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Custom hook for offline mode.

-   :
    -   **Summary:** Service for offline data caching and synchronization.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Updated  interface to include detailed ,  (as ), and .
        -   Refactored  to store the detailed  data in the offline queue.
        -   Added a new key  for offline inspection data.
        -   Fixed a syntax error ( instead of ).
-   :
    -   **Summary:** Script to create test data.
    -   **Changes:** Modified to include default uniform settings (C1 and a Tenue test with specified criteria) directly into MongoDB, and also to clear any existing inspection data for robust testing.

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop remaining core functionalities: reports, communication, import/export Excel.
-   Fully implement the organigramme feature, including re-implementing zoom/pan functionality.
-   Permanently resolve the  mismatch by potentially creating a custom development build or guiding the user on Expo Go version management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving an issue where uniform inspections could not be saved while the application was offline. The  and  hook were successfully integrated into , and  was updated to correctly queue detailed uniform inspections, with the backend's  endpoint configured to process them.

The user reported an error: impossible denregistrer linspection when attempting an offline save. Through debug logs, it was discovered that a  occurred when the application tried to dynamically  the  module () while the device was disconnected from the internet. Dynamic imports fetch the module at runtime, which is problematic for offline scenarios.

The AI engineer's last action was to modify  to change the dynamic import of  to a static import.

This change aims to ensure  is bundled with the application from the start, making it available even when offline, thus resolving the  error.
