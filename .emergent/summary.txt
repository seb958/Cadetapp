The previous AI engineer successfully brought the CommandHub application from inception, handling complex features and bug fixes. The work transitioned from ensuring  users could take attendance, to building a comprehensive Rapports section with various PDF/Excel exports, including cadet lists, blank inspection sheets, and detailed inspection statistics with graphs. A significant challenge involved debugging backend route registration, complex sorting logic with  values in data, and platform-specific UI interactions (Alert.alert vs. window.confirm). Most recently, the engineer implemented an Excel import for cadets, handling data parsing, grade acronyms, and automatic section creation. However, this last feature seems to have introduced a critical regression, causing the  endpoint to return a 500 error, leaving the admin user list empty. The engineer was about to investigate this new backend error.

The CommandHub application facilitates cadet squadron management, covering JWT authentication, attendance, and an admin panel for CRUD operations, with role synchronization, subgroups, and an organigramme. Offline attendance is also supported. Recent efforts focused on:
1.  **Uniform Inspection:** Enhancing role-based inspections for État-Major and section leaders, preventing self-inspection, and allowing direct uniform type selection.
2.  **Attendance:** Enabling  users to take attendance for all cadets, incorporating guest attendance, and a virtual État-Major section.
3.  **Reports Section (New):** Generate PDF/Excel reports including cadet lists (filtered by section/role, auto-updating), blank uniform inspection sheets (landscape, legible criteria, auto-adjusting to uniform changes), detailed inspection statistics (with score evolution graphs, problematic criteria, comments, squadron-wide stats), and general presence/activity reports. Reports require squadron logo and a simple header. Access granted to Admins and Section Leaders.
4.  **Excel Import/Export (New):**
    *   **Import Cadets:** Import Excel files (, ) with cadet names, grades (using provided acronyms, case-insensitive), and sections ( maps to ). Automatically generate usernames, set default role 'cadet'. Update existing cadets' grade/section upon import, ignore duplicates. Automatically create new sections if they don't exist (case-insensitive matching). Report changes, with an option to undo.
    *   **Individual Cadet Report (Export PDF):** Generate a PDF with a cadet's complete data (inspections, presences).

    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes**: Received extensive modifications. Report-related imports (, , ) and all API endpoints for reports () and cadet import () were moved to appear *before*  to ensure proper route registration. Implemented report generation functions (, , , ) with fixes for sorting  values and PDF layout. Enhanced  with score graphs, problematic criteria, and comments. Added  and section normalization logic (e.g., État major to État-Major) for Excel import. New endpoints for previewing and confirming cadet imports were added, handling user/section creation/updates.

    -   **Changes**: Implemented UI for file selection, previewing changes, and confirming import. Uses  to handle file input. Crucially, the confirmation dialog was updated to use  for web compatibility, as  did not function as expected on web. Includes logic to display import results (new cadets, updated cadets, new sections, errors).

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop remaining core functionalities: communication, other types of reports (attendance, activities from earlier suggestions).
-   Fully implement the organigramme feature, including zoom/pan functionality and hiding modification buttons for cadets.
-   Resolve any underlying  mismatch issues.
-   Configure and build the iOS native application.
-   Implement the individual cadet PDF export (only import and general reports are done so far).
-   Fix the 500 Internal Server Error occurring when accessing the  endpoint.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and refined the Excel import functionality for cadets. This involved setting up backend endpoints (, ), handling  dependency for  files, implementing grade acronym mapping and automatic section creation/normalization (e.g., État major to État-Major), and developing the frontend UI in . A key frontend bug for web users was resolved by changing the import confirmation dialog from  (which has limitations on web) to . The user confirmed that the import preview and confirmation steps were now functional.

However, after performing an Excel import, the user reported a new critical issue: when navigating to the Admin section, no users were displayed. The frontend console logs confirmed a . This indicates a regression in the backend's user retrieval endpoint, likely caused by the recent import operation. The engineer's last action was to acknowledge this 500 error and indicate the next step would be to investigate the backend logs for the  endpoint.
