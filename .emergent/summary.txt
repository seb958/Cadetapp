The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex set of bug fixes and feature enhancements for the CommandHub application. Key challenges included stabilizing the PWA and native Android build process, resolving persistent caching issues with the Service Worker, and correcting authentication logic that caused automatic logouts. Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing new product features: enabling read-only access to uniform inspections and the organigramme for regular cadets, incorporating a section selector in the organigramme, and developing a robust guest attendance feature with proper UI/UX. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in both frontend (Expo/React Native) and backend (FastAPI/MongoDB) development, consistently debugging API errors, state management, and UI rendering issues. The final work involves structuring the attendance for cadet staff into a virtual État-Major section.

The CommandHub application facilitates cadet squadron management, encompassing JWT authentication, attendance tracking, and an admin panel for CRUD operations on activities, users, sections, and squadron settings. It supports role synchronization, subgroups, and an organigramme. Offline mode for presence tracking was an existing feature.

Recent development extended to:
1.  **Uniform Inspection**: Admins define criteria, section leaders/superiors score 0-4. Features include a detailed form, modal for past scores, marking absent cadets as present upon inspection, and uniform scheduling. Cadets now view their own scores and compare them against averages.
2.  **Platform Transition**: Due to PWA offline limitations, a shift to native Android APK (with future iOS support), direct downloads, and OTA updates was necessary.
3.  **Data Consistency**: Correct cadet section assignments, conflict resolution, and consistent branding.
4.  **Version Management**: Notify users of new versions, enabling soft/mandatory updates via GitHub Releases.
5.  **User Password Management**: Admins set/reset temporary passwords, force first-time password changes, and generate usernames.
6.  **User Profile Page**: Users view details and change passwords.
7.  **Organigramme Access**: All authenticated users can view it; only superiors can modify. A section selector was added for filtering.
8.  **Guest Attendance**: Allow recording presence for unregistered guests, integrated into quick and detailed attendance modes. Section leaders are included in attendance lists, while Commandant de la Garde roles are explicitly differentiated from officers for attendance purposes. A virtual État-Major section groups specific cadet staff in attendance.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: Expo (React Native) frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Mobile Development**: Expo Router for routing, EAS Build for native APK,  for offline data.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure sessions, password hashing.
-   **Offline First**: Service Worker (initially problematic, now disabled), client-side caching.
-   **Data Serialization**: Handling  and  objects in MongoDB/FastAPI.
-   **Frontend UI/UX**: Modal management, Toast notifications,  for web compatibility.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture consisting of an Expo (React Native) frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   :
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application handling all API routes.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Added  model and  endpoint to fetch personal inspection statistics.
        -   Added  endpoint to retrieve all users, sections, and roles for public display, explicitly converting MongoDB  to string for JSON serialization.
        -   Modified  and  models to include , , .
        -   Updated  POST endpoint to handle guest creation (generates  ) and ensures  is stored as an ISO string.
        -   Updated  GET endpoint to correctly deserialize  (handling both  objects and ISO strings from MongoDB) and to include guest details.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: PWA service worker for offline caching.
    -   **Changes**: Completely disabled its caching functionality and request interception to resolve persistent caching issues during development.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Main dashboard, entry point for auth/offline logic.
    -   **Changes**: Updated authentication status check to use  instead of  (which requires admin permissions).
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Administrative interface for user management.
    -   **Changes**: Updated authentication status check to use .
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Screen for managing uniform inspections.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented conditional rendering to show a cadet-specific view (displaying personal inspection stats) or an inspector view based on user roles. Integrated fetching personal stats using . Added styles for the new cadet view. Corrected data loading logic to properly use .
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Organigramme (organizational chart) display.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Initially, attempted graceful 403 error handling for cadets, then shifted to redirecting unauthorized users.
        -   Updated  to redirect cadets to the previous screen with an alert, preventing unnecessary data loading for restricted roles.
        -   Fixed  state not resetting on early return, preventing infinite loading loops.
        -   Removed cadet blocking logic to allow read-only access for all users.
        -   Updated to use the new  endpoint.
        -   Implemented a section selector UI using  buttons and modified  and  to filter displayed data by the selected section. Added corresponding styles.

    -   **Summary**: Screen for managing attendance.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Added state variables for guest modal (, , ).
        -   Implemented  function to add guest presences via the backend API.
        -   Integrated Ajouter un invité button and  into both Prise Détaillée and Prise Rapide (via ) modals. Removed standalone guest button.
        -   Replaced  with  for guest confirmation and added a visible  component for displaying messages.

        -   Modified  filter to include section leaders (e.g., Commandant de la Garde) while explicitly excluding Officier roles, and introduced a virtual État-Major section for specific cadet staff.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on ensuring that cadet staff (e.g., , ) are correctly identified and displayed within the attendance list under a virtual État-Major section.

The problem arose because these specific roles were not regular cadets or section leaders, nor were they officers, yet their presence needed to be recorded and displayed appropriately. The previous action involved modifying the  function in  to group these roles into this virtual section for display.

The last successful edit was to  to apply this grouping logic. The immediate next step in the trajectory was to restart the frontend and then replicate this virtual grouping logic within the  component to ensure consistency across both attendance modes.
