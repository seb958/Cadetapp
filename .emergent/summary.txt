The previous AI engineer focused on enhancing the CommandHub application, initially implementing uniform inspection features with offline capabilities. A major pivot occurred when PWA offline functionality proved inadequate, necessitating a native Android build via EAS. This build process was fraught with debugging Node.js version mismatches, missing dependencies, npm conflicts, and configuration errors (, ). A critical issue was the app crashing in production due to development environment variables. After resolving these, a  dependency failure halted the build.

The work then shifted to making the app offline-first, implementing a robust versioning system, and then password management. Significant debugging cycles were spent resolving backend  (e.g., ), frontend  errors, and persistent issues with frontend component visibility. The most recent, recurring problem involved the Service Worker aggressively caching old code, preventing new fixes from appearing without manual cache clearing. The trajectory concludes with attempts to fully disable the problematic Service Worker.

The CommandHub application manages cadet squadrons, including JWT auth, attendance, and an admin panel for CRUD on activities, users, sections, and squadron settings. It supports role sync, subgroups, and an organigramme. Offline mode for presences was an existing feature.

Recent development centered on **Uniform Inspection**:
1.  **Detailed Inspection**: Based on admin-defined criteria with a 0-4 numerical score.
2.  **Permissions**: Restricted to section leaders and superiors.
3.  **UI/UX**: Detailed form, modal for viewing past inspection scores.
4.  **Presence Integration**: Saving an inspection marks an absent cadet as present.
5.  **Uniform Scheduling**: Select uniform of the day.
6.  **Offline Capability**: Transitioned from insufficient PWA to native Android APK with future iOS, direct download, and OTA updates.
7.  **Data Consistency**: Correct cadet section assignments, conflict resolution (oldest inspection, latest presence).
8.  **Branding**: CommandHub app name, custom logo/colors.
9.  **Scalability**: Support for 300-500 cadets.
10. **Version Management**: Implement a system to notify users of new versions, with options for soft or mandatory updates, and download via GitHub Releases.
11. **User Password Management**:
    *   Admin can set/reset temporary passwords for existing users.
    *   Generate a password and display it for the admin to convey.
    *   Force users to change their password on first login.
12. **User Profile Page**: Allow users to view their details and change their password.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into debugging the  in the frontend. The user reported that this modal, which requires a new user to change their password on first login, would not close after clicking Changer le mot de passe, even after previous fixes and confirming the backend API () was returning a  status.

This issue (modal not closing and no network request appearing) led to the recurring problem of the PWA  aggressively caching old frontend code, preventing updated JavaScript from being served. Despite previous attempts to clear cache or use incognito mode, the service worker continued to cause problems.

The last action taken by the AI engineer was to modify  to attempt to temporarily disable its caching functionality and prevent it from interfering with frontend development and debugging. The trajectory ends with this modification being applied to the service worker file. The effectiveness of this particular modification and the underlying cause of the modal not closing are the immediate focus.

<optional_next_step>
Verify if disabling the service worker resolves the frontend caching issue and allows the password change modal to close correctly.
