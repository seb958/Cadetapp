The AI engineer successfully initiated development of the Cahier des charges MVP – Application de gestion pour escadron de cadets, focusing on mobile/web responsiveness using Expo. The project began with a comprehensive authentication system (JWT, role-based permissions, email invitations) for four user roles, including admin, cadet admin, cadet responsible, and cadet. The work progressed to implementing flexible presence management, allowing selective and activity-based attendance tracking, alongside backend APIs and frontend UI adjustments for these features.

Further development tackled the administration panel, starting with activity management (recurring/punctual activities, cadet assignment) and then user management (creation, optional email, grade assignment). Crucially, the AI addressed circular dependencies in user and section creation, enabling sections without assigned leaders and users without sections. The latest work focuses on improving user experience by displaying all user profiles (even unconfirmed ones), sending email invitations upon email addition, and enhancing delete functionality for users and sections by moving delete actions to edit modals with confirmation prompts.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a mobile/web application for managing cadet squadron attendance and uniform inspections, ensuring role-based access.

**Key Roles & Permissions:**
*   **Cadet:** Views own data.
*   **Cadet Responsible:** Takes attendance/inspects uniforms for own section, views section stats.
*   **Cadet Admin:** Manages accounts, imports/exports data, centralizes attendance, publishes news.
*   **Encadrement:** Global data access, defines inspection criteria, manages official reports, supervises messaging, publishes news.

**MVP Features Implemented So Far:**
1.  **Authentication:** JWT-based, 4 roles, email invitation system (admin creates account -> email invite -> user sets password), profile photos (base64).
2.  **Attendance:**
    *   Take attendance by responsible/admin/encadrement.
    *   Flexible modes: Tous les cadets (all), Sélection de cadets (individual/selective), Liste dactivité" (predefined lists).
    *   Activity lists: Recurring (e.g., bi-weekly music class) and punctual (e.g., glider day).
    *   Mark absence as "motivated."
3.  **Administration Panel:**
    *   **Activities Management:** Create, modify, delete activities; assign cadets, configure recurrence.
    *   **User Management:** Create/invite users (name, email, grade, role, section); email optional at creation; send invite email if added later.
    *   **Section Management:** Create, modify, delete sections; assign responsible (initially nullable); assign cadets to sections.
    *   Deletion of users/sections moved to edit modals with confirmation.

**Technical Aspects:** Responsive mobile/web, online-only, real-time central database (MongoDB), weekly backups.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Development:** Expo (frontend) + FastAPI (backend) + MongoDB (database).
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt for password hashing, Motor for async MongoDB.
- **Frontend Framework:** React Native with Expo Router for file-based navigation.
- **State Management:** `useState`, `useEffect` for local component state.
- **UI Libraries:** React Native components, custom styling with `StyleSheet.create`.
- **Data Handling:** REST APIs for CRUD operations, Pydantic for data models.
- **Environment:** Dockerized Kubernetes, `supervisorctl` for service management.
- **Error Handling:** Frontend null checks, backend Pydantic validation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with a `backend` (FastAPI) and `frontend` (Expo React Native) directory.

-   `/app/backend/server.py`:
    -   **Summary:** Core FastAPI application handling all backend logic, API endpoints, database interactions with MongoDB (Motor), and authentication.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Initial setup for JWT authentication, user registration, login, role-based authorization.
        -   MongoDB models for `User`, `Section`, `Presence`, `Activity`.
        -   API endpoints for user authentication (login, register, invite, set password).
        -   Endpoints for managing `Presence` (create, get, update).
        -   Endpoints for managing `Activity` (create, get, update, delete).
        -   Endpoints for managing `User` (create, get, update - including optional email, grade updates, and automatic invitation on email add).
        -   Endpoints for managing `Section` (create, get, update - including nullable `responsable_id`).
        -   Implemented `Grade` enum and extended it to include all specific cadet grades and legacy grades for backward compatibility.
        -   Fixed date serialization and `null` value handling for optional fields.

-   `/app/frontend/app/index.tsx`:
    -   **Summary:** The main entry point for the Expo Router application, handling initial routing and navigation.
    -   **Changes:**

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the user experience and administrative capabilities, specifically focusing on user and section management. The last reported actions were:

1.  **Backend updates for user management:** Ensuring all users (active/inactive) are fetched, and that an invitation email is sent automatically when an email is added to a user profile that was initially created without one.
2.  **Frontend updates for user list:** Adding an indicator for user activity/confirmation status ( field).
3.  **Frontend UI Refinement for Deletion:**
    *   The Delete button for users was removed from the main user list.
    *   A dangerous delete zone with a confirmation prompt was added to the user modification modal, making deletion a more deliberate action.
    *   The process of relocating the Delete button for sections from the main section list to the section modification modal was initiated and partially completed (the trajectory ends during this step, specifically after modifying  to remove the button from the list and prepare for its addition to the modal).

The immediate task being addressed is the improvement of the deletion UX for sections, mirroring the changes already applied to user deletion.

<optional_next_step>
