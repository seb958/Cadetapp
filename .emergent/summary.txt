The AI engineer's work spanned several critical features and bug fixes. Initially, it involved generating missing usernames for test users and attempting to resolve a React Native version mismatch by updating Expo SDK. This led to the discovery that Expo SDK 55 was not yet stable, prompting a recommendation for a custom development build or web preview, with the web preview successfully demonstrating the application's functionality.

Subsequently, a major initiative for offline functionality with data synchronization was implemented. This involved significant modifications to the FastAPI backend for sync endpoints, Pydantic models, and extensive frontend work in Expo. The frontend incorporated local caching using , network detection with , and a synchronization queue. Debugging this feature was iterative, focusing on Pydantic validation errors, JWT token authentication for sync, and particularly a persistent offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes error. This was resolved by meticulously normalizing all timestamps to UTC in the backend.

Finally, the focus shifted to enhancing attendance taking. A new  component was developed, integrating section-based collapsible lists, real-time search, and a swipe right for present mechanism that automatically marks unswiped cadets as absent. The existing presence modification feature was updated with a 24-hour edit window for all authorized users and permanent admin-only editing thereafter. A final bug regarding cadet name display in the new UI was fixed by correcting property names from  to  based on the  interface.

<product_requirements>
The application serves as a cadet squadron management system, designed to manage cadet attendance, administration, and organizational structure.

**Initial Core Features:**
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based system with email invitations for four distinct roles.
-   **Attendance:** Flexible recording system, including motivated absence.
-   **Administration Panel:** Provides comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for activities, user management (invitation, editing, deletion), sections, and squadron-specific settings such as presence recording, uniform inspections, and data backup.

**Implemented Enhancements:**
-   **Role Synchronization:** User-defined roles, created within the Rôles administration tab, are seamlessly integrated and selectable in user creation and editing forms.
-   **Subgroup Management:**
    -   Sections can now optionally contain hierarchical subgroups.
    -   Each subgroup can have its own designated responsible, who reports to the parent section's responsible.
    -   Cadets are primarily assigned to a subgroup, while still being members of their parent section.
    -   Cadet counts within subgroups contribute to the overall section total.
-   **Organigramme (Organizational Chart):**
    -   Provides a traditional tree-like visualization of the squadron hierarchy with clear connection lines.
    -   Displays Name, Grade, and Role for each individual.
    -   Sections and subgroups are presented in expandable boxes, showing their responsible and cadet count.
    -   Hierarchy levels include Commandant, Officers, Adjudant-Chef d'escadron, Adjudant d'escadron, Sections, Sub-groups, and individual Cadets.
    -   Staff positions (e.g., Cadet Senior à l'administration) are integrated.
    -   Accessible from the main menu.
    -   Initial requests for zoom/pan and horizontal alignment were temporarily reverted due to technical issues.
-   **Offline Mode with Synchronization:**
    -   Allows recording of presences and uniform inspections without a stable internet connection.
    -   Data is intelligently merged upon connection restoration; for instance, a uniform inspection recording by a section commander will automatically mark a cadet as present if not already recorded.
    -   Supports both automatic and manual data synchronization with a maximum offline usage duration of 6 hours.
-   **Improved Attendance Taking Ergonomics:**
    -   Cadets are organized by collapsible sections for easier navigation.
    -   Includes a real-time search bar for quick cadet lookup.
    -   A swipe right gesture marks a cadet as present, and the cadet is then removed from the visible list.
    -   Any cadet not swiped (i.e., remaining in the list) is automatically marked as absent.
    -   The list dynamically compacts, showing only unswiped cadets.
-   **Presence Modification:**
    -   Allows direct modification of recorded presences by clicking on them.
    -   Permissions: Any authorized user can modify presences within a 24-hour window from the recording time. After 24 hours, only an administrator can modify them.
    -   Modifications involve a simple replacement of the presence status without maintaining a historical log within the app.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a major feature set focused on improving attendance taking and presence modification.

1.  **Improved Attendance Taking:** The  screen was significantly refactored.
    *   It now organizes cadets by  in collapsible lists.
    *   A new  component was introduced to handle the core interaction: users swipe right on a cadet to mark them , and the cadet disappears from the list. Cadets not swiped are automatically marked .
    *   A real-time search bar was integrated into  for efficient cadet lookup.
2.  **Presence Modification:** The backend's  PUT endpoint in  was modified to enforce business rules for modification:
    *   Presences can be modified by any authorized user within 24 hours of recording.
    *   After 24 hours, only an administrator can modify a presence.
    *   Modification is a simple replacement of the existing presence status.
3.  **Bug Fix - Cadet Name Display:** A critical UI bug was resolved in  where cadet names were not displaying correctly (only grades appeared). This was due to a mismatch between the  interface properties (, ) and the properties being accessed in the  component (, ). The mapping was corrected to use  and  when passing data to the  component.

The user confirmed Tout fonctionne bien after this last fix, indicating that the improved attendance taking and modification features, including the name display, are now fully functional. The AI engineer's last action was to restart the frontend.

<optional_next_step>
The last explicit task (fixing cadet name display) was concluded. I will await the user's next request for further features or improvements.
