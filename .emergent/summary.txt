The trajectory details the AI engineer's efforts to resolve critical Android APK build issues for the CommandHub Expo application. Initially, the AI addressed Node.js version conflicts, a missing splash screen asset, and  C++ compilation errors due to  deprecation in  0.81.5. The engineer guided the user to update  for Node.js, create , and downgrade , , and  versions to a compatible set (19.0.0, 0.79.5, 3.17.4 respectively). Despite

<product_requirements>
The CommandHub application is designed for cadet squadron management, featuring JWT authentication, attendance tracking, admin CRUD operations, role synchronization, subgroups, and an organigramme, with offline capabilities. Implemented features include a robust reports section generating various PDF/Excel reports (now including individual cadet PDF reports for both admins and cadets) and an Excel import function for cadet data (names, grades, sections, automatic usernames), which fixed a previous 500 error. UI/UX enhancements include improved contrast for score buttons in uniform inspections, an updated login page with a squadron logo, and a critical scrolling bug fix in the swipeable attendance component. The application is successfully deployed, with user-specific requirements including manual distribution, Expo account usage, v1.0.0 initial version, automatic updates, persistent user sessions, and Android APK prioritization.

<code_architecture>


-   : Core FastAPI application. Modified to fix Pydantic model issues and added  endpoint, later deprecated for static serving.
-   : Main entry/login. Updated UI with squadron logo and title.
-   : Uniform inspections. Modified score buttons for contrast.
-   : User profile. Added Générer Rapport Individuel button.
-   : Admin reports. Added Rapport Cadet tab.
-   : Attendance component. Replaced  with  for vertical scrolling.
-   : EAS build configuration. Modified  profile to specify  to resolve Node.js compatibility.
-   : Project dependencies. Updated  to ,  to , and  to  to resolve C++ compilation issues. (Previously updated to 19.1.0, 0.81.5, 3.18.0 which caused C++ issues).
-   : Project ZIP archive, moved here for public download.
-   : Splash screen asset. Created to resolve a missing file error.
