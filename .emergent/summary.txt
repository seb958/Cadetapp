<analysis>
The AI engineer systematically addressed several complex feature and bug requests for the CommandHub application. Initially, the focus was on accurately representing a virtual État-Major section in attendance by modifying  to ensure this logic was correctly passed to . Subsequent work centered on enhancing uniform inspections, allowing specific roles (État-Major, section leaders) to inspect others while preventing self-inspection, which involved updates to both frontend () and backend () permissions. A critical bug related to uniform type selection for inspectors was resolved by enabling direct selection within the UI and fixing overly restrictive backend API permissions. Finally, the engineer worked on allowing cadets with  to take attendance, requiring updates to backend presence permissions and frontend data loading logic in  to ensure cadets were visible. This trajectory demonstrates robust debugging and a methodical approach to full-stack development.

<product_requirements>
The CommandHub application manages cadet squadron activities, including JWT authentication, attendance, and an admin panel for CRUD operations. It features role synchronization, subgroups, and an organigramme. Offline mode for attendance was already present.

Recent feature enhancements and bug fixes include:
1.  **Uniform Inspection**: Admins define criteria; superiors score. Cadets can view their own scores. New functionality allows État-Major members and section leaders to inspect other cadets (excluding self-inspection) and select uniform types directly, especially for offline scenarios.
2.  **Platform Transition**: Migration to native Android APKs with direct downloads and OTA updates due to PWA limitations.
3.  **Data Consistency**: Ensured correct cadet section assignments and consistent branding.
4.  **Version Management**: User notifications for new versions and update mechanisms.
5.  **User Password Management**: Admin tools for temporary passwords, forced password changes, and username generation.
6.  **User Profile Page**: Allows users to view details and change passwords.
7.  **Organigramme Access**: All authenticated users can view; superiors can modify. A section selector was added for filtering.
8.  **Guest Attendance**: Capability to record presence for unregistered guests in both quick and detailed modes. Section leaders are explicitly included in attendance lists, and a virtual État-Major section groups specific cadet staff. Additionally, cadets with  can now take attendance.

    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application for all API routes and data interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Added/modified uniform inspection endpoints (, ), presence handling for guests (), and organigramme public access (). Implemented server-side validation to prevent self-inspection, adjusted role handling for section leaders, and refined permissions for , , and  to accommodate various inspector roles and . Modified  to include  users.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Service worker for PWA functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Caching and request interception were explicitly disabled to resolve development issues.
-   , :
    -   **Summary**: Entry points and administrative screen.
    -   **Changes**: Updated authentication status checks to use a more appropriate backend endpoint ().
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Screen for managing and viewing uniform inspections.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented role-based conditional rendering (cadet vs. inspector views), fetching personal stats.  was updated to filter based on inspector roles and apply État-Major grouping. Critical changes included adding  state and modifying  and  to allow inspectors to choose the uniform type directly, removing prior blocking conditions.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Displays the organizational chart.
    -   **Changes**: Enabled read-only access for all authenticated users, updated to use the new  endpoint, and integrated a section selector for data filtering.

    -   **Summary**: Screen for attendance tracking.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented guest attendance functionality with modals and toast notifications. Modified  to include section leaders, exclude Officier roles, and introduced a virtual État-Major section grouping specific cadet staff, ensuring this virtual section data is correctly passed to . Updated  logic to include users with , and ensured  and  call  for these users.
-   :
    -   **Summary**: Component for quick attendance marking.
    -   **Changes**: Adapted  for web compatibility, enabled the Valider button to mark absences, and integrated an Invité button for guest attendance, receiving processed section data including the virtual État-Major.
-    and :
    -   **Summary**: Handle offline data management and synchronization.
    -   **Changes**: Involved in debugging an issue where  was not correctly resolved for the  endpoint; the primary fix involved adjusting backend data access permissions for this endpoint.

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop remaining core functionalities: reports, communication, import/export Excel.
-   Fully implement the organigramme feature, including re-implementing zoom/pan functionality.
-   Permanently resolve any underlying  mismatch issues that might resurface.
-   Configure and build the iOS native application.
-   Hide modification buttons for cadets in the organigramme view.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a bug reported by the user: a cadet with  (e.g., ) could access the detailed and swipe attendance menus but observed no cadets listed for presence recording.

The previous work involved multiple fixes related to :
1.  Backend  in  was updated to allow these users to access presence-related endpoints.
2.  Backend  in  was modified to provide comprehensive data, not just personal data, to users with .
3.  Frontend  logic in  was updated to display the attendance buttons for these users.

Despite these changes, the user still reported an empty cadet list. The engineer diagnosed that the  function, responsible for populating the cadet list, was not being triggered for users with  in the frontend. This was due to the conditional checks within  and  functions in  still relying solely on traditional roles ().

The last actions taken were:
1.  Modifying  in  (around line 168) to include  in the condition for calling .
2.  Applying the same fix to the  function in  (around line 312).
3.  Restarting the frontend.

The system is currently in a state where these frontend logic updates have been applied, and the next step is to verify their effectiveness.
